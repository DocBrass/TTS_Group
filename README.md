While in quarantine I've been watching a lot of new shows. 
Here are some I recommend:

1. The Walking Dead
	I've tried to avoid watching this show but I could no longer resist. 

2. Itaewon Class
	A Korean drama that has plenty of episodes. 

3. Ru Paul's Drag Race
	Talent...

4. Vampire Diaries
	

5. Glee
	Watch at your own risk
